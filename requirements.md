# Tetris Game Project Requirements

## Project Overview
This project is a modern implementation of the classic **Tetris** puzzle game, featuring both single-player and multiplayer modes. It aims to recreate the iconic Tetris experience with authentic mechanics and a retro aesthetic while introducing competitive online play. Players will be able to enjoy traditional solo Tetris gameplay or challenge friends and other players in real-time head-to-head matches. The focus is on delivering smooth gameplay and an engaging user experience in both modes.

## Features
For the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), the application will support two primary game modes with the following features:

### 1. Single Player Mode
- Standard Tetris gameplay where a single player stacks falling tetromino blocks to clear lines and earn points.
- Adheres to official Tetris rotation rules and mechanics, ensuring the game feels true to the classic Tetris experience (proper piece shapes, rotations, scoring, etc.).

### 2. Multiplayer Mode
- Online competitive play with minimal latency, allowing two players from anywhere in the world to compete in real time.
- Secret/unique room links for private games, enabling players to create a private match and invite a friend via a shared link.
- **Post-MVP Addition:** Game result history between two players for future reference. (Planned feature to record outcomes of matches so players can review their win/loss history once this is implemented after the MVP launch.)

## UI/UX Design
The user interface will embrace a **retro Game Boy** aesthetic to invoke nostalgia, combined with modern touches for clarity. The game screen and menus will feature a simple, pixelated design reminiscent of classic handheld Tetris. However, unlike the original monochrome Game Boy version, the falling Tetrimino pieces will be displayed in their standard distinct colors to make them easily distinguishable and add visual appeal. Overall, the UI/UX will balance old-school charm with readability and responsive controls for a satisfying player experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React ‚Äì building the game UI and controls as a web application using React for efficient UI updates and component-based development.
- **Backend:** Java ‚Äì powering the game server logic, including game state management and multiplayer coordination on a robust Java backend.
- **Networking:** Utilize free, open technologies for real-time multiplayer synchronization (e.g., WebSockets for bi-directional communication). This will handle sending game state updates (piece positions, line clears, etc.) between players quickly without reliance on paid services, ensuring low-latency interactions.

## Additional Considerations
In addition to the core features above, the development will emphasize the following:

- **Maintainability & Extensibility:** Write clean, well-documented, and modular code. The architecture should allow for future enhancements (such as new game modes, power-ups, or additional statistics tracking) with minimal refactoring. This ensures the project can evolve beyond the MVP and be easily maintained over time.
- **Efficient Game Synchronization:** Ensure the multiplayer mode has a robust synchronization mechanism so both players' games stay in lockstep. The design will minimize network lag and handle synchronization of events (like line clears and garbage lines) fairly, providing a smooth and competitive experience even under varying network conditions. This is crucial for fairness in head-to-head play.
